I'm a stay-at-home dad with two boys, and a part-time visiting lecturer at [Roehampton University](https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/).

I am an inquisitive and versatile engineer and technical leader. I enjoy solving problems in research and development, security, software and reverse engineering. Recently, Iâ€™ve setup [Cyber Springboard](https://cyberspringboard.com/) to help more people build the skills and knowledge to start a career in cyber.
